We revamped their site to make it mobile-first and streamlined the design by dividing the site into three distinct sections, their residential services, their commercial services, and ways to contact and learn more about the company. By dividing their residential and commercial services users are better able to identify what cleaning service package they need and results in more people hiring the service.`
